# 💰 Project: Simple Expense Tracker

## Goal
Build a Python script that allows users to:
1.  **Add** an expense (category, amount, description).
2.  **View** all expenses.
3.  **Save** expenses to a file (data persistence).

## Skills Used
*   Variables & Inputs
*   Lists & Dictionaries
*   File I/O (Reading/Writing text or CSV files)
*   Functions

## Instructions
1.  Open `main.py`.
2.  Implement the `add_expense` function.
3.  Implement the `view_expenses` function.
4.  Try to save the data to `expenses.txt` so it's there when you run the program again!
