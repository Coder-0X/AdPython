    "\n",
    "When you execute `pd.read_csv('data/example.csv')`, the following occurs at the system level:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Buffering & Tokenization**: \n",
    "    - The OS reads the file from the disk in chunks (typically 4KB or 8KB pages) into a memory buffer.\n",
    "    - The Pandas C-engine (written in C for speed) iterates over this byte stream, identifying delimiters (`,`) and newlines (`\\n`) to tokenize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Type Inference**:\n",
    "    - Pandas samples the first N rows (or the whole file if small) to infer data types.\n",
    "    - It allocates memory for **NumPy arrays**.\n",
    "    - **Integers/Floats**: Stored efficiently in contiguous blocks of memory (e.g., `int64` takes 8 bytes per value).\n",
    "    - **Strings/Objects**: Stored as an array of pointers to Python objects. This is much less memory-efficient than numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Block Manager**:\n",
    "    - Pandas does not store columns purely individually. It groups columns of the same type into **Blocks**.\n",
    "    - If you have 3 Integer columns, they might be stored as a single `(3, N)` NumPy array matrix. This improves CPU cache locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Takeaway*: CSVs are text-heavy. The in-memory DataFrame representation is often **larger** than the file size on disk because ASCII text is converted into heavy Python objects or fixed-width NumPy types."

    "\n",
    "Handling unstructured text gives you the most control over memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **File Descriptors & Buffers**:\n",
    "    - `open()` requests a file descriptor from the OS.\n",
    "    - A specific buffer size is allocated (e.g., 4096 bytes).\n",
    "    - When you read, the disk head moves, fills the buffer, and Python reads from RAM (the buffer).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Load vs. Stream**:\n",
    "    - **`read()`**: Loads the **entire** file contents into a single Python string. For a 10GB log file, this will crash your program (MemoryError).\n",
    "    - **`for line in f:`**: This is a **Lazy Iterator**. Python reads just enough bytes to find the next newline logic (`\\n`).\n",
    "    - At any specific moment, only one line is stored in Python's memory. The previous line is discarded (eligible for Garbage Collection).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  **Encoding**:\n",
    "    - Files are stored as bytes (0s and 1s).\n",
    "    - `open(..., encoding='utf-8')` applies a decoding layer. It converts raw bytes into **Unicode Code Points** (Python strings).\n",
    "    - This decoding has a small CPU cost but ensures valid character representation logic."
